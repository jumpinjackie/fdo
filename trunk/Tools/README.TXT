	FDO Tools
	=========

This directory (fdo/Tools) is intended as a home for fdo user tools - 
either commandline or GUI.  That is tools for doing translations, 
inquiries or processing using FDO.  

It is intended that there will be a relatively low barrier for users to 
contribute new tools in this tree so the quality of the tools may vary
substantially.  The following list differentiates between tools supported
by the FDO Project, and those that are contributed "as is", but not actively
supported by the project team. 


Supported Tools
===============


Unsupported Tools
=================

fdorastutil
-----------

A commandline tool for querying information about raster 
datasources, and for translating fdo raster data sources 
GeoTIFF format.  Useful primarily for checking raster data
sources, either for developers or fdo users. 

Status: Only builds easily on Linux, poorly documented.
