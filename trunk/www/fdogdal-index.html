			 <h1>Feature Data Objects Provider for GDAL</h1>
			 <h2>Overview</h2>
			 <p>
			 The Feature Data Objects (FDO) API provides access to data
			 in a data store.
			 A provider is a specific implementation of the FDO API
			 that provides access to data in a particular data store.
			 The FDO Provider for GDAL provides FDO with access to a
			 variety of raster file formats supported by the OSGeo GDAL library.
			 </p>
			 <h2>Characteristics</h2>
			 <p>
			 The FDO Provider for GDAL has the following characteristics:
			 </p>
			 <ul>
						<li>
						Read-only access is provided to raster data in
						supported formats.
						</li>
						<li>
						Geolocation and coordinate information is read
						where available and depending on the capabilities
						of each GDAL format driver.
						</li>
						<li>
						Supported formats include JPEG, GIF, PNG, GeoTIFF,
						NITF, Imagine, PCIDSK, DTED.
						Depending on optional items built into GDAL, formats
						including JPEG2000, ECW, MrSID, and HDF may be available.
						</li>
						<li>
						Schema configuration of the data store is provided to
						the FDO Provider for GDAL through an XML file containing
						the Geographic Markup Language (GML) definition of the
						schema that maps raster data files in the data store to
						feature classes and property mappings in the FDO data model.
						</li>
						<li>
						Currently the FDO Provider for GDAL does not support
						the MOSAIC operation. This capability is under development.
						</li>
						<li>
						The FDO Provider for GDAL does not currently support
						the Bitonal color model. Bitonal TIFF files are promoted
						to 8 bit integers with values 0 and 1.
						</li>
			 </ul>
			 <h2>Connection</h2>
			 <p>
			 This information supplements the Establishing a Connection chapter
			 in the FDO Developers Guide.
			 </p>
			 <p>
			 You can connect to FDO Provider for GDAL by specifying the
			 DefaultRasterFileLocation of the raster file(s) that you want to use. 
			 This parameter may correspond to a single file or a directory
			 containing a number of raster files.
			 </p>
