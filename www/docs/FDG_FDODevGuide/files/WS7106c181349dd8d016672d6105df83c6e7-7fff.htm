         </p>
                        
         <p>A feature is an abstraction of a natural or
            man-made real world object. It is related directly or indirectly
            to geographic locations. A spatial feature has one or more geometric
            properties. For example, a road feature might be represented by
            a line, and a hydrant might be represented by a point. A non-spatial
            feature does not have geometry, but can be related to a spatial
            feature which does. For example, a road feature may contain a sidewalk
            feature that is defined as not containing a geometry.

         <p>
                              A
            schema is a logical description of the data types used to model
            real-world objects. A schema is not the actual data instances (that
            is, not a particular road or land parcel), rather it is metadata.
            A schema is a model of the types of data that would be found in
            a data store. For example, a schema which models the layout of city
            streets has a class called Road, and this class has a property called
            Name. The definition of Road and its associated classes constitute
            the schema.

         </p>
                        
         <p>
                              A
            schema override comprises instructions to override the default schema mappings.
            For example, an RDBMS-type FDO provider could map a feature class
            to a table of the same name by default. A schema override might
            map the class to a differently named table, for example, by mapping
            the "pole" class to the "telco_pole" table.

         <p>
                              A
            Schema Mapping is a correspondence between a Schema Element and
            a physical object in a data store. For example, OSGeo FDO Provider
            for MySQL maps each Feature Class onto a table in the MySQL database
            where the data store resides. The physical structure of data stores
            for each FDO provider can vary greatly, so the types of Schema Mappings
            can also vary between providers. Each provider defines a set of
            default schema mappings. For example, OSGeo FDO Provider for MySQL
            maps a class to a table of the same name by default. These defaults
            can be overridden by specifying Schema Overrides.

                              A
            schema consists of a collection of schema elements. In the FDO API, schema
            elements are related to one another by derivation and by aggregation.
            An element of a schema defines a particular type of data, such as
            a feature class or a property, or an association. For example, a
            feature class definition for a road includes the class name (for
            example, Road), and the class properties (for example, Name, NumberLanes,
            PavementType, and Geometry).

                              A
            feature class is a schema element that describes a type of real-world
            object. It includes a class name and property definitions, including
            zero or more geometric properties. It describes the type of data
            that would be included in object instances of that type.

                              A
            property is a single attribute of a class and a class is defined
            by one or more property definitions. For example, a Road feature
            class may have properties called Name, NumberLanes, or Location.
            A property has a particular type, which can be a simple type, such
            as a string or number, or a complex type defined by a class, such
            as an Address type, which itself is defined by a set of properties,
            such as StreetNumber, StreetName, or StreetType.

                                    The
               FdoAssociationPropertyDefinition class is used to model a peer-to-peer relationship
               between two classes. This relationship is defined at schema creation
               time and instantiated at object creation time. The association property supports
               various cardinality settings, cascading locks, and differing delete rules.
               An FDO filter can be based on association properties and FdoIFeatureReader
               can handle associated objects through the GetObject() method.

                                    Dimensionality,
               and the concept of dimension, has two different meanings in the
               discussion of geometry and geometric property.
            </p>
                              
            <p>The first is called shape dimensionality, and
               it is defined by the FdoGeometricType enumeration. The four shapes
               are point (0 dimensions), curve (1 dimensions), surface (2 dimensions),
               and solid (3 dimensions).

            <p>The other is called ordinate dimensionality,
               and it is defined by the GisDimensionality enumeration. There are
               four ordinate dimensions: XY, XYZ, XYM, and XYZM. M stands for measure.

                                    An
               instance of a geometric property contains an object that represents
               a geometry value. The definition of the geometric property may restrict
               an object to represent a geometry that always has the same shape,
               such as a point, or it could allow different object instances to
               have different dimensions. For example, one geometric property object
               could represent a point and another could represent a line. Any
               combination of shapes is permissible in the specification of the
               geometric types that a geometry property definition permits. The
               default geometric property specifies that an object could represent
               a geometry that is any one of the four shapes.
            </p>
                              
            <p>With respect to ordinate dimensionality, all

               geometry is represented using geometric constructs either defined
               as lists of one or more XY or XYZ points or defined parametrically,
               for example, as a circular arc. While geometry typically is two-
               or three-dimensional, it may also contain the measurement dimension
               (M) to provide the basis for dynamic segments.

                                    An
               object property is a complex property type that can be used within
               a class, and an object property, itself, is defined by a class definition.
               For example, the Address type example described previously in the
               Property definition. An object property may define a single instance
               for each class object instance (for example, an address property
               of a land parcel), or may represent a list of instances of that
               class type per instance of the owning class (for example, inspection
               records as a complex property of an electrical device feature class).

                              A
            spatial context describes the general metadata or parameters within
            which geometry for a collection of features resides. In particular,
            the spatial context includes the definition of the coordinate system,
            spheroid parameters, units, spatial extents, and so on for a collection
            of geometries owned by features.
         </p>
                        
         <p>Spatial context can be described as the “coordinate
            system plus identity.” Any geometries that are to be spatially related
            must be in a common spatial context.
         </p>
                        
         <p>The identity component is required in order
            to support separate workspaces, such as schematic diagrams, which
            are non-georeferenced. Also, it supports georeferenced cases. For
            example, two users might create drawings using some default spatial
            parameters (for example, rectangular and 10,000x10,000), although
            each drawing had nothing to do with the other. If the drawings were
            put into a common database, the users could preserve not only the
            spatial parameters, but also the container aspect of their data,
            using spatial context.

                              A
            data store is a repository of an integrated set of objects. The
            objects in a data store are modeled either by classes or feature
            classes defined within one or more schemas. For example, a data
            store may contain data for both a LandUse schema and a TelcoOutsidePlant
            schema. Some data stores can represent data in only one schema,
            while other data stores can represent data in many schemas (for
            example, RDBMS-based data stores, such as MySQL).
