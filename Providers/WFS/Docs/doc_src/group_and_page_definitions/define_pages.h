\note
There is NO public API documentation for the FDO Provider for WFS.
Functionality is available only through the main FDO API.

<p>The Feature Data Objects (FDO) API provides access to data in a 
data store. A provider is a specific implementation of the FDO API 
that provides access to data in a particular data store. The FDO 
Provider for WFS provides FDO with access to a WFS-based data store.

<p>An OGC Web Feature Service (WFS) provides access to geographic features that 
are stored in an opaque data store in a client/server environment. A client 
uses WFS to retrieve geospatial data that is encoded in Geography Markup 
Language (GML) from a single or multiple WFS. The communication between client 
and server is encoded in XML. If the WFS response includes feature geometries, 
it is encoded in Geography Markup Language (GML), which is specified in the 
OpenGIS Geographic Markup Language Implementation Specification. WFS is a 
read-only provider.
</p>

<p>A WFS schema can support the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inheritance
  <li>Multiple schemas
  <li>Object properties
  <li>Association properties
  <li>These geometry types: point, line string, polygon, multi-point, 
  multi-line string, multi-polygon, multi-geometry, curve string, curve polygon, 
  multi-curve string, multi-curve polygon, linear ring, line string segment, 
  circular arc segment, and ring.
</ul>
